# System-Analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a fairly new company that is seeking a learning management system for online driver education, testing, and appointments for in-person drivig lessions. 

What did you do particularly well?
I was able to ascertain the client's needs and determine functional, nonfunctional, and technical requirements for the design. I also created easy-to-read diagrams that could be shared with presented to the client.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to take another look at my UML Class Diagram included in the System Design Document. I could improve this diagram by adding methods and more attributes.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It's very important to consider the client's need within system design because the system must meet the client's needs in order to be considered effective. I strive to design an system that resolves the client's issues within their budget, time, and technical constraints.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach software design with a focus on customer requirements and constraints in order to provide the highest quality product. It's important to start by determining requirements, then create lving models and diagrams for the design, and using effective and efficient automated testing to ensure that the client's needs are being met throughout the process.
